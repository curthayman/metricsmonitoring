**metricsmonitoring.py** is a Python script for monitoring Pantheon site metrics, detecting traffic anomalies, and alerting on low cache efficiency. It sends detailed, actionable Slack notifications to help you quickly identify and address performance issues.

## Features

- Monitors multiple Pantheon sites for traffic spikes and cache efficiency
- Sends rich Slack alerts with historical trends, performance impact, and improvement tips
- Integrates with Pantheon’s Terminus CLI
- Easy configuration via YAML and environment variables
